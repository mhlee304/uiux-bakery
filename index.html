        <h1>Yale School of Art Responsive Redesign</h1>

        <h2 class="project-section-header">Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="project-description">This project was for CSCI1300: User Interface and User Interaction focusing on redesigning a simple website.
          Our task was to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.
          I choose to redesign <b >Yale School of Art's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">website</a>.</b>
        </p>
        <h2 class="project-section-header"> Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems </h2>
        <img class="yale-bad" src="./yale-bad.png" alt="Original Yale School of Art Website">        
        <p class="project-description">
          I chose this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">website</a> because I was surprised that the Yale School of Art would have such a terrible design. I think they are doing it ironically, but I thought it would be interesting to analyze why I think that this design is bad and find ways to improve it.

        <p>
          In addition to analyzing the website on the three usability guidelines, I also used WebAIM Wave to detect possible accessibility problems. However, it said that there are no errors in the website, which I am very surprised about.  I thought it would have a lot of accessibility problems due to the bad color choices and the navigational problems. However, according to the WebAIM WAVE, it doesnâ€™t detect any possible accessibility problems.

        <h2 class="project-section-header">Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
        <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
        <p>For this section, I created a low fidelity wireframe that gives a layout on how I would want to redesign the website to solve many of the current issues. (Feel free to navigate in the embedded wireframes)</p>

        <h3>Visual Design Guide</h3>
        <p>For this section, I decided on the colors, typography, and images I would want for the High Fidelity Wireframe.</p>
        <img src="./visual-design-guide.jpg" width="100%" alt="Persona 1: Connor, a first-time user with the Panini Press">
        <h3>High Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
        <p>Based on the same layout from the low fidelity wireframe and the visual design guide, I then created a more detailed layout with the specific colors, typography, and images that I would want in my HTML/CSS website. (Feel free to navigate in the embedded wireframes)</p>

        <h2 class="project-section-header">Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p>For this section, I used the Hi-Fi Wireframing as a layout for the website that I made in HTML and CSS. Below is the screenshots of the website and the link to the website can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://groovylynx123.github.io/yale-school-of-art/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="project-section-header">Key Takeaways</h2>
        <p>From this project, I learned how to identify flaws within a current website, identify its core problems, and ideate its potential solutions. From these proposed solutions,
          I was able to create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various device dimensions. I was also able to create a responsive redesign of a website using HTML and CSS.</p>
